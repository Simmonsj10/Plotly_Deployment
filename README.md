## Summary
The human body harbors thousands of bacteria. We intend to use this bacteria to synthesize a meat protein product called "Improbable Beef". We have taken clincial data from 153 test subjects and tracked bacteria samples. This bacteria will be used to create a new tasty meat product. This website analyzes the cohort of 153 test subjects and provides 3 interactive charts and 1 interactive table to review the individual test subjects.
